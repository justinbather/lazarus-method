Course and Progress Tracking Web Application for Dr. Ryan Lazarus in California, a Naturopath focused on helping patients improve their health
and wellness physically, mentally, and spiritually.

This Web App uses the Django Framework with Python, Postgres, JS, HTML, and CSS.

This app helps patients in the program track their progress through questionnaires and physical test results that provide a score based on 7 
categories of their health. The patients check off tasks associated with their current belt (or level) and upon completion of each belt they are
posed with a new questionnaire to update their wellness scores. This allows patients to see a trend in their health as they progress through the program.
